# InkSpace (Story-Hub)

InkSpace is a modern, maintainable full-stack web application for reading, writing, and discovering stories. It features a modular architecture with a PostgreSQL database, RESTful API using Express, and a bundled SPA frontend.

## Key Features
- **Dual Authentication System:** Separate authentication for authors and readers with distinct JWT tokens. Fixed bottom login bar provides clear access to both login options. Prevents dual login (reader + author simultaneously) to avoid session conflicts.
- **Reader Accounts:** Dedicated reader authentication system with bookmarks, reading history tracking, author following, and 1-5 star ratings. Readers can write detailed reviews, post comments on stories, and manage their personal reading library.
- **Reviews & Comments System:**
  - Readers can write comprehensive reviews with title, rating (1-5 stars), and detailed text (50-2000 characters)
  - One review per reader per book with edit/delete capabilities
  - "Helpful" voting system to highlight useful reviews (one vote per reader per review)
  - Comment system for quick feedback on books
  - **Two-way threaded reply system**: Authors and readers can reply to reviews and comments, enabling conversation
  - Authors can respond from their dashboard or the Book Reviews analytics page
- **Reader Experience:** Browse trending stories, customize reading themes and font sizes, bookmark chapters, follow authors, write reviews and comments with threaded discussions, and download works as PDFs.
- **Author Portal:** Secure JWT-based authentication allows authors to publish works using a rich Quill editor, manage drafts, track reading statistics, view review analytics, and engage with readers through replies.
- **Author Analytics:**
  - Comprehensive review statistics dashboard (total reviews, average rating, rating breakdown)
  - Book Reviews page with filtering (by star rating) and sorting (newest, oldest, highest/lowest rating, most helpful)
  - Recent comments section in dashboard with reply functionality
  - Rating analytics view showing all ratings for each book
- **Professional Author Profiles:**
  - Banner image with gradient overlay for visual appeal
  - Large circular avatar with verified badge (1000+ followers)
  - Comprehensive statistics: total works, followers, total reads, weighted average rating
  - Dynamic achievement badges: Popular Author (1000+ followers), Prolific Writer (10+ works), Highly Rated (4.5+ stars), Best Seller (100k+ views)
  - Social media integration: Website, Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, GitHub links
  - Recent activity section with activity status indicator (Very Active/Active/Moderately Active/Inactive)
  - Publishing frequency tracking and last 3 published works display
  - Profile editing modal for authors to update bio, avatar, banner, location, and social links
  - Follow/unfollow button for readers with real-time follower count updates
  - Published works grid with cover images and ratings
- **Real-time Notifications:**
  - Database-driven notification system with 30-second polling
  - Notification bell with unread count badge
  - Authors receive notifications for: new followers, new ratings, new comments, comment replies
  - Readers receive notifications for: new chapters from followed authors, author replies, comment replies
  - Click-to-navigate: notifications take you directly to relevant content
  - Automatic tab switching and smooth scrolling to context
  - Separate notification streams for authors and readers
- **RESTful API:** A fully secured Node.js backend using Express that handles structured interactions with the PostgreSQL database.
- **Data Security:** Passwords are cryptographically hashed using `bcryptjs`. Separate JWT tokens for authors and readers. Mutating API endpoints are protected with strict authorization checks and ownership validation.
- **Offline Capabilities:** Uses a Service Worker (`sw.js`) to provide offline caching and PWA installation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules), Vite bundler, HTML5, CSS (Tailwind)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js (ES6 modules)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (`pg`)
- **Security:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), `bcryptjs`
- **Build System:** Vite for development and production builds

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A running PostgreSQL instance (e.g., via Docker)

### Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd inkspace
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start a local PostgreSQL database:**
   ```bash
   docker run --name storyhub-db \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres \
     -p 5432:5432 -d postgres:15
   ```

4. **Development mode (recommended):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This starts both the backend server (port 3000) and Vite dev server (port 5173) concurrently.
   - Backend API: http://localhost:3000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173

5. **Production mode:**
   ```bash
   # Build frontend
   npm run build

   # Start server (serves built files from dist/)
   npm start
   ```
   Access the app at http://localhost:3000

### Database Configuration

The application automatically creates the `storyhub` database and seeds it with demo content if it doesn't exist.

Default connection: `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/storyhub`

To use a different database, set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable:
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname npm start
```

### Demo Accounts

The auto-seeder initializes demo accounts for testing:

**Author Accounts:**
- **elena@inkspace.com** / password
- **marcus@inkspace.com** / password

**Reader Accounts:**
- **reader1@inkspace.com** / password
- **reader2@inkspace.com** / password

## NPM Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development environment (backend + Vite dev server)
- `npm run dev:server` - Start backend server only
- `npm run dev:client` - Start Vite dev server only

## Development Guidelines

See [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for detailed development guidelines including:
- Code organization principles
- API conventions
- Database patterns
- Frontend architecture
- Security best practices
- Testing standards

## Migration from Legacy Structure

The project has been restructured from a monolithic single-file architecture to a modular system for better maintainability. Legacy files (`app.js`, `server.js`, `db.js`) are kept for reference but are deprecated. All new development should use the new modular structure under `server/` and `src/` directories.

## Contributing

1. Follow the coding guidelines in CLAUDE.md
2. Use ES6 module syntax (import/export)
3. Maintain separation of concerns (routes, models, views)
4. Test both API endpoints and UI functionality
5. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing data
